### üëã Hi, I am Sungwon (Dora). I am a computational linguist with two MAs in Linguistics and in the Korean language, driven by advancing natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) that align with human values. I strive to bridge linguistic theory and AI to push the boundaries of NLP applications across diverse business domains.
